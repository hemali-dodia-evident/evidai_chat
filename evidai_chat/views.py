                Last Question Category - `{last_ques_cat}`  

                ### **Step 1: If Explicit Asset Name is Found, Return Asset Name**
                - Normalize asset names for matching by **removing spaces, dashes, and capitalization** before comparison.  
                - If the question contains an **exact match** or **a close match** (considering typos/misspellings), return that asset name immediately.  
                - **If a new asset is matched, update the active asset before returning the result.**  
                - **STRICTLY DO NOT return `{last_asset}` if a new asset is found.**  
                - Treat **spaces (" "), dashes ("-"), and underscores ("_") as equivalent** when matching asset names.  
                - **Ignore case sensitivity** when matching.  
                - **"&" and "and" should be treated as equivalent.**  
                - **Once an asset is matched, STOP further processing.**  

                #### **Asset Name Matching Priority:**  
                - If an exact asset name is found in `{asset_names}`, return it immediately.  
                - If a close match (with minor typos/misspellings) is found, return the closest matching asset.  
                - Treat **"&" and "and"** as equivalent when matching asset names.  
                - **Normalize asset names before comparison** (remove spaces, dashes, underscores, and convert to lowercase).  
                - If multiple assets match, separate them with `","`.  

                #### **Example Normalization:**
                | User Input  | Matched Asset          |
                |-------------|------------------------|
                | OpenAI      | OpenAI - Co-Investment |
                | Open AI     | OpenAI - Co-Investment |

                | openai      | OpenAI - Co-Investment |
                | open_ai     | OpenAI - Co-Investment |

                - If an asset is found, **STOP and return the name immediately**.  
                - If no match is found, continue to Step 2. 

                ### **Step 2: If Last Question Category is "Owned Assets", Return "1"**
                - If `{last_ques_cat} == "Owned Assets"` and question is about user-owned assets, holdings, trades, and commitments, **IMMEDIATELY RETURN `"1"`**.  
                - **DO NOT check for `{last_asset}` here.**  
                - Owned Asset Data (ONLY THIS DATA IS AVAILABLE):
                    - Trade Details: Trade Asset, Price, Total Units, Available Units, Trade Units, Trade Status, Number of Clients, Asset Maker
                    - Commitment Details: Asset Name, Commitment Amount, Allotted Units, Commitment Status  
                - If question is unrelated to these topics, proceed to Step 3.  

                ### **Step 3: If Last Question Category is "Personal Assets" and a Relevant Topic is Found, Return `{last_asset}`**
                - If `{last_ques_cat} == "Personal Assets"`, **ONLY return `{last_asset}` if Step 1 DID NOT FIND A NEW ASSET**.  
                - **If Step 1 found a new asset, `{last_asset}` is ignored.**
